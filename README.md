# CS22002---Modern-Web-Stack-Development
Welcome to the Modern Web Stack Development module! This module will introduce you to the key concepts, tools, and practices for developing dynamic, interactive, and responsive web applications. Throughout this module, you will gain hands-on experience with front-end and back-end web development, equipping you with essential skills for building modern, full-stack web applications.


What You Will Learn

This module is divided into two main sections, covering both client-side and server-side development:

Front-End Development (JavaScript)

* Writing and understanding JavaScript for web interactivity.
* Fetching and manipulating data from APIs.
* Working with JSON and building dynamic, data-driven interfaces.
* Handling user interactions with event listeners and DOM manipulation.

Back-End Development (Flask)

* Integrating a database to manage persistent data.
*  Deploying and hosting web applications.

How the Module is Structured

The module runs over SEM2 and is broken into the following key topics:

1. Weeks 1-5: Front-End Development

    * JavaScript essentials, dynamic interfaces, and API integration.

1. Weeks 7-11: Back-End Development

    * Building RESTful web applications, managing databases, and deploying Flask projects.

Each week includes:

* Lectures to introduce core concepts.
* Labs to apply what you’ve learned through hands-on exercises.


What You’ll Achieve by the End of the Module

By the end of this module, you will:

* Have a solid understanding of modern web development practices.
